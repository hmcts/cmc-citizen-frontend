Arguments are not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to modify the prototype of `Object`, causing the addition or modification of an existing property that will exist on all objects.  \nParsing the argument `--foo.__proto__.bar baz'` adds a `bar` property with value `baz` to all objects. This is only exploitable if attackers have control over the arguments being passed to `yargs-parser`.\n","recommendation":"Upgrade to versions 13.1.2, 15.0.1, 18.1.1 or later.","references":"- [Snyk Report](https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-YARGSPARSER-560381)","access":"public","severity":"low","cwe":"CWE-471","metadata":{"module_type":"","exploitability":1,"affected_components":""},"url":"https://npmjs.com/advisories/1500"}}}
