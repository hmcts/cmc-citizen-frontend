This is the frontend application for CMC. Service provides web UI for citizens, presented as sequence of HTML 5 web pages designed to GDS Service Design guidelines, so that they can make money claims and / or perform associated actions e.g submitting defence or requesting default judgement.

Service delegates most of the non UI responsibilities to underlying services e.g. claim-store or pdf-service.
